# brelaz_dsatur_graph_coloring_algorithm
A TreeSet can be utilized to store the vertices in the graph which will be colored. All the colors which can be used stored as a HashSet. With TreeSets, the complexity for READ, INSERT, &amp; DELETE are O(log |V|). So, when finding a node with the maximum saturation degree, we are finding the last element in the TreeSet, which is the farthest to the right in the tree. And every time we color a new node, we do not need to compute the saturation degree of every node (whose time complexity is O(|V|*|E|)) again. We only need to update the saturation degree and the colors all the neighbors have used of the adjacent nodes of the colored one, whose time complexity is O(|E|*log|V|).
